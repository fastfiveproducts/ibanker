This app is known as "iBanker", available for iOS (iPhone and iPad).  iBanker replaces paper money and the job of “banker” in board games like Monopoly® and The Game of Life®. All transactions of money to and from “the bank” are supported, as well as transfers from one player to another. iBanker adds to the fun by allowing players to set a picture for themselves, and sound effects chime-in for most transactions. The Spinner function provides the Spin to Win® function for the electronic banking version of The Game of Life®.
