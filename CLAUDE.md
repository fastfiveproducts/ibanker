# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

# Instructions
You MUST read ./AGENTS.md at the start of every conversation and re-read it after any context compaction. Follow all coding standards, project structure notes, and rules defined in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).

# Shell Commands
Never chain shell commands with `&&`, `;`, or `|`. Never use flags like `-C` to avoid `cd`. Run each command as its own separate Bash tool call. This is critical — chained commands break the permission system and slow down approved workflows.
